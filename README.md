# GBuild_ConnecTall
Backend Building Competition


This website starts with the basic auhentication.... 
User can signup or login to website which Takes user to the home page of the website...!
In Home page of this Website , U will be seeing two containers one is for necessary nav links and one is for reminders and Google technologies.
In nav links section, User can add as many subjects they want! After successful addition of subject it will be automatically added to subject list and that subject will be appended to the test score adding subject dropdown.!
So it will become easy for the user to add the test scores by selecting the subject user need.
Test score tracker will save all your responses and keep the track of all those things until u delete any..!
similary , the expense tracker will take the input from the user and saves it to the database everytime thereby keeping track of all your expenses!
Coming to Attendance link ,, It will take user to the page where user can see your own activity whichever is recorded!!!!! User can see his attendance percentage for each subject that has been registered in subjects page.
The Calendar thing which I have created is very dynamic ,, U can add the events to calendar and save it forever! all basic virtual calendar functions can be seen!!
Then coming to Assignments and Courses ... These will take necessary input from user and saves it to the databases! (Deadline will also be taken from user)
If the Deadline is less than or equal to 3 days .. it will be shown in "Reminders" part of the website's home page.
This Reminders part of the page is very dynamic and auto updated!!

Lastly I have added 2 Google Tech Stacks (DRIVE and COLAB) to help the user to keep user organised and able to collaborate with user's mates in a easy way.
I have given editable access to the user soo user can manage his resourses repo however he/she want!!
